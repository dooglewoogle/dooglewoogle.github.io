Title: Dancing Lines
Date: 29/11/2021

This was one direction I explored while doing lookdev for some client work.
The idea was to have it be part ribbon dance, part shape exploration, and part light painting

A little while later I had the opportunity to come back to it. Seeing the final product above, the first thing I wanted to 
do was make it run in realime. After some work I got a version running in Unreal Engine.
While the dance is the same, I was able to make the trails react to live audio, as well as control parameters and cameras live.

This video was entirely captured in engine.

Ultimately I would love this to be a part of a live performance, with dance, music, and trails all being performed simultaneously.
