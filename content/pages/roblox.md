Title: Roblox
Date: 15/10/2022

As part of an ongoing effort to explore new playspaces and connect with fans I had the chance to
rebuild the world from the tv show Jane and the Dragon.  
The process started with cleaning up and updating 15 year old model files used in production. 
From there, they were piece by piece imported and placed into a Roblox world.
