Title: Neural Style Transfer
Date: 29/11/2021

Some client work had me experimenting with neural style transfer. 
The images below are either 3D renders of stock or marketplace assets, or photos I've taken,
They were then all ran through a machine learning stylization process. 

The style transferring was done with [Pystiche](https://github.com/pystiche/pystiche) and it's no exaggeration to say I couldn't have done it without this.
